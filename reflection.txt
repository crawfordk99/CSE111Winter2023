Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

The best example was me having to create at least 7 functions in my self-project.
Having to make sure they only did 1 thing helped me to break down what I 
wanted my project to accomplish, and made my code more clear. It helped me
understand the purpose of functions better, and also helped me when I needed
to create test functions.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions make sure you're functions are doing what you want them to do
all the time through testing different scenarios for you without having to run
through your program multiple times. Also, it's never a bad thing to have a 
2nd witness of the efficiency of your program even if you're super confident
you did it right.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

If the exception/problem is obvious I tend to just go right in and fix it. If
it's not, I try to debug, and usually I'll put a breakpoint where the function
is called in main, and then jump into it. I'll look at what's going on with
the variables, and try to see what's wrong/experiment with changes. I think
1 thing I can do better is understanding what I'm trying to do better haha. But
seriously, sometimes I don't know where to put my breakpoints because I don't 
actually know what I'm trying to do. Part of that could be getting better 
at keeping my functions simple and concise, and to 1 thing.
